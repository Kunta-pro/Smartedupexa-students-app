<h2>4.1 Photosynthesis</h2>
<p>Nutrition in plants is by a process called photosynthesis. The process occurs in all green plants in organelles called chloroplasts, most of which are found in leaves. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, which traps sunlight energy. The process of photosynthesis can be summarized by the equations below.</p>

<h3>Structure of a Chloroplast</h3>
<div class="highlight">
    <p>Chloroplasts are the primary site for photosynthesis and contain chlorophyll, essential for absorbing light energy.</p>
</div>

<h3>Conditions Necessary for Photosynthesis</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chlorophyll:</strong> A green pigment that absorbs light energy from the sun, essential for photosynthesis.</li>
    <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide:</strong> Absorbed by terrestrial plants through stomata; aquatic plants absorb CO<sub>2</sub> as hydrogen carbonates.</li>
    <li><strong>Light:</strong> A critical energy source for photosynthesis, necessary for splitting water molecules (photolysis).</li>
    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Influences enzyme activity; photosynthesis rate increases with temperature until enzymes are denatured at high temperatures.</li>
    <li><strong>Water:</strong> A raw material for photosynthesis absorbed by root hairs and transported via xylem vessels.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.2 The Leaf as an Organ of Photosynthesis</h3>
<p>The leaf is the primary organ for photosynthesis and is adapted both externally and internally to maximize this process.</p>
<h4>External Adaptations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Broad and flat leaves provide a large surface area for sunlight absorption.</li>
    <li>Numerous leaves increase the total exposed surface area.</li>
    <li>Thin leaves minimize diffusion distance for gases and sunlight.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Internal Adaptations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Chloroplast-rich palisade mesophyll layer for optimal sunlight absorption.</li>
    <li>Spongy mesophyll layer with air spaces for easy gas diffusion.</li>
    <li>Network of veins (phloem and xylem) for nutrient transport.</li>
    <li>Presence of stomata to regulate gas and water vapor exchange.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.3 Factors Affecting Photosynthesis Rate</h3>

            <th>Effect</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Amount of Chlorophyll</td>
            <td>More chlorophyll increases light absorption, boosting photosynthesis.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration</td>
            <td>Higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels increase photosynthesis rate.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Light Intensity</td>
            <td>Photosynthesis rate rises with light intensity up to a maximum level.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Temperature</td>
            <td>Enzymes work efficiently at optimum temperature, increasing the rate.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Water Availability</td>
            <td>Insufficient water lowers photosynthesis rate.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Importance of Photosynthesis</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Purifies the environment by removing excess CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
    <li>Releases oxygen essential for respiration.</li>
    <li>Provides energy in the form of fuels derived from plants.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gaseous Exchange and Compensation Point</h3>
<p>Both respiration and photosynthesis occur in plants. The compensation point is the light intensity at which the rate of photosynthesis equals the rate of respiration, resulting in no net gas exchange.</p>

<h4>Self-Check Questions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Explain why plants were kept in darkness during the experiment.</li>
    <li>Describe the role of sodium hydroxide in the experimental setup.</li>
    <li>What is the significance of spreading leaves on a white tile before adding iodine?</li>
