      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <p>The branch of biology dealing with naming and classification of living organisms is called taxonomy.</p>
      <p>Classification is the act of putting living things together into groups on the basis of the characteristics they have in common. A group of organisms with similar characteristics is called a taxon (plural: taxa).</p>

      <h2>Carolus Linnaeus</h2>
      <p>A scientist named Carolus Linnaeus introduced a modern way of classifying organisms in 1753.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Types of Classification</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Natural Classification:</strong> Based on natural order or common ancestry informed by science (e.g., the cat family).</li>
        <li><strong>Artificial Classification:</strong> Based on superficial characteristics, imaginations, or human uses (e.g., parasites or pests).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Comparison Between Natural and Artificial Classification</h2>
      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <th>Natural Classification</th>
          <th>Artificial Classification</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Many characteristics are considered.</td>
          <td>Only a few characteristics are considered.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Members of a group are similar in hereditary patterns.</td>
          <td>Members are not similar in hereditary patterns.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Stable and most modern method of classification.</td>
          <td>May change as knowledge about organisms changes.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Provides plenty of useful information.</td>
          <td>Provides only limited information.</td>
        </tr>

      <h2>Importance of Classification</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Makes it easy to study organisms by grouping them based on similar characteristics.</li>
        <li>Helps understand the evolutionary relationship (phylogeny) between different organisms.</li>
        <li>Prevents confusion around the scientific world by organizing information about organisms.</li>
        <li>Provides a universal way of arranging information about organisms.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Levels of Classification</h2>
      <p>There are seven levels of taxonomy:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Species:</strong> A group of organisms with similar characteristics capable of breeding freely to produce fertile offspring.</li>
        <li><strong>Genus:</strong> A group of closely related species.</li>
        <li><strong>Family:</strong> A group of closely related genera.</li>
        <li><strong>Order:</strong> A group of closely related families.</li>
        <li><strong>Class:</strong> A group of closely related orders.</li>
        <li><strong>Phylum:</strong> A group of closely related classes.</li>
        <li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> A group of organisms belonging to closely related phyla.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

      <h2>Scientific Naming of Living Organisms</h2>
      <p>The <strong>binomial system</strong> gives two unique Latin names to an organism, beginning with the genus name followed by the species name.</p>
      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <th>Organism</th>
          <th>Genus</th>
          <th>Species</th>
          <th>Scientific Name</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Onion</td>
          <td>Allium</td>
          <td>Cepa</td>
          <td><i>Allium cepa</i></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Man</td>
          <td>Homo</td>
          <td>Sapiens</td>
          <td><i>Homo sapiens</i></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Housefly</td>
          <td>Musca</td>
          <td>Domestica</td>
          <td><i>Musca domestica</i></td>
        </tr>
        <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
      </table>

      <h2>Dichotomous Key</h2>
      <p>The word "dichotomy" means divided into two parts. A dichotomous key is a set of instructions used to identify unknown organisms. It provides two contrasting statements leading to a group or specific organism.</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Compound or simple leaf
          <ul>
            <li>(a) Compound leaf (leaf divided into leaflets) ... go to 2</li>
            <li>(b) Simple leaf (leaf not divided into leaflets) ... go to 3</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Arrangement of leaflets
          <ul>
            <li>(a) Digitate arrangement of leaflets ... Cassava</li>
            <li>(b) Pinnate arrangement of leaflets ... Eucalyptus</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
