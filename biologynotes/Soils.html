    <h1>Soil and Its Importance</h1>
    <p>Soil is a finely divided material covering the Earth's crust or surface. It consists of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Air</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Humus</li>
        <li>Living organisms</li>
        <li>Weathered rocks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of Soil</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Soil provides nutrients like water and minerals to plants, which are the chief producers of food in the environment.</li>
        <li>It is a habitat for many organisms such as earthworms, termites, bacteria, fungi, and arthropods.</li>
        <li>Soil acts as a medium for disposing of wastes for humans and other animals.</li>
        <li>It is an important natural resource for construction materials, agriculture, crafts, and art materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Soil Formation</h2>
    <p>Soil is formed from parent rocks through the process of weathering over several years. Weathering occurs in three main ways:</p>
    <h3>1. Physical Weathering</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alternate heating and cooling:</strong> Causes expansion and contraction of rocks, leading to cracking and breaking.</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> Rivers and streams wear away rocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Sandstorms:</strong> Wind blows sand against bare rocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Frosting:</strong> Freezing water in cracks expands, causing rocks to break.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Chemical Weathering</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rain dissolves carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid, which dissolves soft rocks like limestone.</li>
        <li>Hot, damp conditions lead to oxidation of rocks, forming soil.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="chemical-weathering.jpg" alt="Chemical weathering example">

    <h3>3. Biological Weathering</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Organisms like lichens and small plants grow on rocks, contributing to humus formation.</li>
        <li>Humans split rocks directly during construction and indirectly through cultivation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Factors Influencing Soil Formation</h2>
    <p>Five major factors influence soil formation:</p>

            <tr>
                <td>Time</td>
                <td>Longer formation time results in deeper, mature soils.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Types of Soil</h2>
    <p>Soil is classified based on particle size and nature into three main types:</p>
    <h3>Sandy Soil</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Large spaces between particles allow water to drain quickly.</li>
        <li>Gritty feel when wet and low in calcium and magnesium.</li>
        <li>Described as light soils, easy to work with.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Clay Soil</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fine particles with poor drainage, prone to waterlogging.</li>
        <li>Sticky feel when wet and difficult to work with, called heavy soils.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Loam Soil</h3>
    <p>A mixture of sand, silt, clay, and organic matter, with a stable crumb structure, making it ideal for crop production.</p>

    <h2>1.2 Soil Layers</h2>
    <p>Soil consists of distinct layers, referred to as horizons, that form the vertical arrangement of the soil profile. A soil profile with clearly defined layers is mature, while one without is considered young or immature. The main layers include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Topsoil</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Subsoil</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Parent Rock</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Diagram to show the soil profile:</p>
    <img src="soil-profile.jpg" alt="Soil profile diagram">

    <h3>Horizon A – Topsoil</h3>
    <p>This is the uppermost layer, approximately 20cm deep. It is the most important horizon for supporting plant growth.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Better aerated than other layers.</li>
        <li>Rich in active soil microorganisms and humus, giving it a dark color.</li>
        <li>Contains more plant roots and litter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Horizon B – Subsoil</h3>
    <p>This is a thicker, light-brown layer beneath the topsoil, mainly composed of rock fragments, clay, and gravel.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Less aerated compared to topsoil.</li>
        <li>Contains few deep plant roots and minimal organisms.</li>
        <li>Very little or no humus present.</li>
        <li>Rich in mineral salts due to leaching, referred to as the layer of accumulation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Horizon C – Parent Rock</h3>
    <p>This is the solid rock layer found below the subsoil, representing the original unweathered parent material.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Composed of granite, volcanic rocks, and sedimentary rocks.</li>
        <li>Lacks humus, has low air content, and contains minimal mineral salts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.3 Components of Soil</h2>
    <p>Soil is composed of six main components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inorganic particles</li>
        <li>Humus</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Air</li>
        <li>Mineral salts</li>
        <li>Soil living organisms</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Inorganic Particles</h3>
    <p>These are formed through the weathering process and vary in size. They include clay, silt, fine sand, coarse sand, and gravel.</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Soil Particle</th>

        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides anchorage for plant roots, supporting plants.</li>
        <li>Gives a rigid framework to soil.</li>
        <li>Supplies mineral elements to plants.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Soil Air</h3>
    <p>Soil air exists in the spaces between particles and is vital for plant roots and soil organisms. It consists mainly of oxygen and nitrogen.</p>
    <p><strong>Importance:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides oxygen for respiration of organisms and roots.</li>
        <li>Facilitates decay processes that produce humus.</li>
        <li>Supplies nitrogen for fixation by bacteria, aiding in nitrate formation.</li>
        <li>Helps in weathering by forming carbonic acid with CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Soil Water</h3>
    <p>Soil water comes from rain and groundwater, forming a thin film around particles.</p>
    <p><strong>Functions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintains soil moisture for microorganism survival.</li>
        <li>Dissolves mineral salts for plant absorption.</li>
        <li>Supports plant cell rigidity, aiding herbaceous plant structure.</li>
        <li>Raw material for photosynthesis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Humus</h3>
    <p>Humus is the decayed remains of plants and animals, including fallen leaves, dead bodies, and droppings. It is dark brown, sticky, and crucial for soil health.</p>
    <p><strong>Importance:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhances soil warmth, aiding seed germination.</li>
        <li>Improves water retention and aeration.</li>
        <li>Provides nutrients and stabilizes soil pH.</li>
        <li>Encourages soil organism activity by providing food and shelter.</li>
        <li>Improves soil structure by binding particles into clumps.</li>
