    <h1>Soil and Its Importance</h1>
    <p>Soil is a finely divided material covering the Earth's crust or surface. It consists of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Air</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Humus</li>
        <li>Living organisms</li>
        <li>Weathered rocks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of Soil</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Soil provides nutrients like water and minerals to plants, which are the chief producers of food in the environment.</li>
        <li>It is a habitat for many organisms such as earthworms, termites, bacteria, fungi, and arthropods.</li>
        <li>Soil acts as a medium for disposing of wastes for humans and other animals.</li>
        <li>It is an important natural resource for construction materials, agriculture, crafts, and art materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Soil Formation</h2>
    <p>Soil is formed from parent rocks through the process of weathering over several years. Weathering occurs in three main ways:</p>
    <h3>1. Physical Weathering</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alternate heating and cooling:</strong> Causes expansion and contraction of rocks, leading to cracking and breaking.</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> Rivers and streams wear away rocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Sandstorms:</strong> Wind blows sand against bare rocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Frosting:</strong> Freezing water in cracks expands, causing rocks to break.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Chemical Weathering</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rain dissolves carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid, which dissolves soft rocks like limestone.</li>
        <li>Hot, damp conditions lead to oxidation of rocks, forming soil.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Biological Weathering</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Organisms like lichens and small plants grow on rocks, contributing to humus formation.</li>
        <li>Humans split rocks directly during construction and indirectly through cultivation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Factors Influencing Soil Formation</h2>
    <p>Five major factors influence soil formation:</p>

            <tr>
                <th>Factor</th>
                <th>Explanation</th>

            <tr>
                <td>Climate</td>
                <td>Rainfall and temperature promote chemical and physical breakdown of parent rocks.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Living Organisms</td>
                <td>Vegetation cover and microorganisms decompose organic material, enriching soil.</td>

            <tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Topography</td>
                <td>Steep slopes lead to erosion, affecting soil depth and composition.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Time</td>
                <td>Longer formation time results in deeper, mature soils.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Types of Soil</h2>
    <p>Soil is classified based on particle size and nature into three main types:</p>
    <h3>Sandy Soil</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Large spaces between particles allow water to drain quickly.</li>
        <li>Gritty feel when wet and low in calcium and magnesium.</li>
        <li>Described as light soils, easy to work with.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Clay Soil</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fine particles with poor drainage, prone to waterlogging.</li>
        <li>Sticky feel when wet and difficult to work with, called heavy soils.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Loam Soil</h3>
    <p>A mixture of sand, silt, clay, and organic matter, with a stable crumb structure, making it ideal for crop production.</p>

            <tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Water rises by capillarity</td>
                <td>Poor capillarity</td>
