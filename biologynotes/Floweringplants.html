    <p>A detailed look at the structure of a flowering plant.</p>

<div class="content">
    <h2>7.1 External Parts of a Typical Flowering Plant</h2>
    <p>Flowering plants consist of two main systems:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Root system</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Shoot system</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These systems are made up of two categories of organs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reproductive organs:</strong> Involved in the reproduction of the plant, producing fruits and seeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetative organs:</strong> Not directly involved in reproduction, including roots, stems, and leaves.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7.2 Parts of a Flowering Plant</h2>
    <h3>LEAVES</h3>
    <p>A leaf is a thin, flattened structure growing from the nodes of a stem or branch. The leaf is made up of 3 main parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Leaf base:</strong> The part that attaches the leaf to the stem.</li>
        <li><strong>Petiole:</strong> The part connecting the leaf base to the leaf blade. Leaves with a petiole are called petiolate.</li>
        <li><strong>Lamina:</strong> The expanded and flattened portion of the leaf consisting of veins and midrib.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Venation</h3>
    <p>Venation refers to the arrangement of veins in the lamina of a leaf. There are two main types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Network venation:</strong> Veins branch and intersect, forming a network. This is characteristic of dicots.</li>
        <li><strong>Parallel venation:</strong> Veins run side by side without branching, common in monocots.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Classification of Leaves</h3>
    <p>Leaves can be classified based on their structure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple leaves:</strong> A single, undivided lamina (e.g., mango, hibiscus).</li>
        <li><strong>Compound leaves:</strong> Lamina completely divided into leaflets (e.g., beans, oxalis).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Compound Leaves</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Type of Leaf</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Example</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Compound Pinnate</td>
                <td>Leaflets arranged along the midrib (rachis).</td>
                <td>Jacaranda</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Compound Bipinnate</td>
                <td>Two orders of leaflets, further divided into pinnules.</td>
                <td>Jacaranda</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Compound Digitate</td>
                <td>Leaflets radiate from the end of the petiole.</td>
                <td>Horse chestnut</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Compound Trifoliate</td>
                <td>Three leaflets in the compound leaf.</td>
                <td>Soya bean</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Leaf Arrangements on a Stem</h3>
    <p>Leaves are arranged on the stem in different ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alternate:</strong> One leaf arises from each node.</li>
        <li><strong>Opposite:</strong> Two leaves arise from each node, opposite each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Whorled:</strong> More than two leaves arise from each node.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Functions of Leaves</h3>
    <p>The primary function of leaves is to manufacture food for the plant through photosynthesis. Other functions include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gas exchange (oxygen and carbon dioxide) via stomata.</li>
        <li>Transpiration to remove excess water.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Modified Leaves</h3>
    <p>Some plants have modified leaves for specific purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Leaf Tendrils:</strong> Used by climbing plants for support.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaf Spines:</strong> Sharp structures for defense.</li>
        <li><strong>Scale Leaves:</strong> Protect axillary buds from damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Insectivorous Leaves:</strong> Capture and digest insects for nutrients.</li>
    </ul>
