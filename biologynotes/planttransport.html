        <h2>The Xylem</h2>
        <p>The xylem consists of xylem vessels and tracheids, responsible for moving water and mineral salts from the roots to the leaves. Xylem vessels are made up of dead, hollow cells with lignified walls that offer structural support and prevent collapse. Key characteristics include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dead cells</li>
            <li>Hollow structure</li>
            <li>Lignified walls</li>
            <li>No protein filaments or cytoplasm</li>
            <li>Transports water and salts</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Phloem</h2>
        <p>The phloem is composed of sieve tubes and companion cells, responsible for transporting sugars and amino acids from the leaves to other plant parts. It consists of living cells and plays a crucial role in food translocation. Key characteristics include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Living cells</li>
            <li>Thin cytoplasm</li>
            <li>Associated with companion cells</li>
            <li>Sieve cross walls</li>
            <li>Contains protein filaments</li>
            <li>Transports food material</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Water Transport in Plants</h2>
        <p>Water moves from the soil to the leaves through a combination of forces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Capillarity:</strong> Movement of water in narrow tubes due to surface tension.</li>
            <li><strong>Cohesion-Tension:</strong> Attraction between water molecules helps maintain a continuous column of water in the xylem.</li>
            <li><strong>Adhesion:</strong> Water's attraction to xylem walls helps support the water column and prevents collapse.</li>
            <li><strong>Root Pressure:</strong> Pressure exerted by roots helps push water up, though it's not sufficient on its own.</li>
            <li><strong>Transpiration Pull:</strong> Water is drawn up from the roots to the leaves as water evaporates through stomata.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Root Hair Adaptations for Water Absorption</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Slender and flexible to navigate between soil particles.</li>
            <li>Numerous to increase surface area for absorption.</li>
            <li>Lack of a cuticle allows easy water absorption.</li>
            <li>Contain mitochondria for ATP production needed for active transport.</li>
            <li>Cell sap has a lower osmotic potential, promoting water uptake by osmosis.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Translocation in Plants</h2>
        <p>Food produced in the leaves is transported to other parts of the plant through the phloem. This process, called translocation, includes mass flow and active transport, ensuring that sugars and amino acids reach growing parts or storage organs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Transpiration</h2>
        <p>Transpiration is the process through which plants lose water vapor, mainly through the leaves. There are different types of transpiration:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stomatal Transpiration:</strong> Occurs through stomata, contributing up to 90% of water loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Cuticular Transpiration:</strong> Occurs through the leaf cuticle, accounting for about 20% of water loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Lenticular Transpiration:</strong> Occurs through lenticels in the stem, contributing about 0.1% of water loss.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Factors Affecting Transpiration</h2>
        <h3>Environmental Factors:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Higher temperatures increase transpiration.</li>
            <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Higher humidity decreases transpiration.</li>
            <li><strong>Wind:</strong> Wind increases transpiration by removing water vapor.</li>
            <li><strong>Light Intensity:</strong> Higher light intensity increases transpiration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Non-Environmental Factors:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Distribution of Stomata:</strong> More stomata increase transpiration.</li>
            <li><strong>Leaf Surface Area:</strong> Larger surface areas increase transpiration.</li>
            <li><strong>Cuticle Thickness:</strong> Thicker cuticles reduce transpiration.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Adaptations to Reduce Transpiration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Shedding leaves to reduce water loss.</li>
            <li>Having fewer stomata, often on the lower leaf surface.</li>
            <li>Thick cuticles and reduced leaf size to minimize transpiration.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Importance of Transpiration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Helps with water movement and nutrient uptake.</li>
            <li>Maintains turgidity in plant cells.</li>
            <li>Provides cooling and helps with mineral transport.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Disadvantages of Transpiration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Excessive water loss can lead to wilting and plant death.</li>
            <li>Overcooling can affect metabolic processes.</li>
        </ul>
