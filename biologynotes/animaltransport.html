    <h2>8.1 Surface Area to Volume Ratio</h2>
    <p>Surface area to volume ratio is an important aspect in gaseous exchange. It is obtained by calculating the total surface area and dividing it by the volume of the object in question. Consider two boxes A and B below:</p>

    <h3>Box A</h3>
    <p>Total surface area (A) = 2(2x1) + 2(1x2) + 2(2x2) = 16 cm²</p>
    <p>Volume of A (V) = 2x1x2 = 4 cm³</p>
    <p>Surface area to volume ratio of A = 16 / 4 = 4</p>

    <h3>Box B</h3>
    <p>Total surface area (A) = 2(3x2) + 2(3x4) + 2(2x4) = 52 cm²</p>
    <p>Volume of B (V) = 4x2x3 = 24 cm³</p>
    <p>Surface area to volume ratio of B = 52 / 24 ≈ 2.3</p>

    <p>The surface area to volume ratio of A is larger than that of B, which shows that smaller objects have a larger surface area to volume ratio than larger ones. This facilitates faster diffusion and ensures that all body tissues are supplied with respiratory gases.</p>

    <h2>8.2 Need for Transport Systems in Animals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Increases surface area of the organism for faster and bulkier exchange of substances.</li>
        <li>Large organisms have a small surface area to volume ratio, so diffusion alone can’t occur.</li>
        <li>Greater metabolic demands require faster delivery of substances to meet body demand.</li>
        <li>The large diffusion distance for transported substances between tissues and their sources necessitates a transport system.</li>
        <li>Organisms need to be supplied with materials for metabolism and excrete waste products.</li>
        <li>In large multicellular organisms, many cells are far from the surface, requiring a system to move materials to and from them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8.3 Components of the Circulatory System</h2>

    <h2>8.4 The Mammalian Heart</h2>
    <p>The heart functions to pump blood around the body and is surrounded by a pericardium. It consists of cardiac muscle tissue and is divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. Blood flow is maintained in one direction by valves.</p>
    <img src="heart_image.jpg" alt="Heart Diagram">
    
    <h2>Cardiac Cycle</h2>
    <p>The cardiac cycle involves two phases: refilling of the heart with blood and pumping of blood. During systole, the heart contracts to pump blood, and during diastole, it relaxes to refill with blood. These phases correspond to the sounds of 'lub' and 'dub' during a heartbeat.</p>

    <h2>8.5 Blood Vessels</h2>
    <h3>Arteries</h3>
    <p>Arteries carry blood away from the heart. They have thick, elastic walls to withstand high pressure.</p>
    <h3>Capillaries</h3>
    <p>Capillaries are small blood vessels with thin walls that allow diffusion of gases, nutrients, and waste products.</p>
    <h3>Veins</h3>
    <p>Veins carry blood back to the heart. They have thinner walls than arteries and contain valves to prevent backflow.</p>

    <h1>Blood and Its Components</h1>
    <p>Blood is a connective tissue made up of cells suspended in a fluid matrix called plasma. There are two types of cells in blood i.e. White blood cells (leucocytes) and red blood cells (erythrocytes). The platelets (thrombocytes) are fragments of cells. In an adult human being, there are five to six liters of blood with blood making up approximately 10% of the body weight.</p>

    <h2>Main components of blood</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Red blood cells/erythrocytes</li>
        <li>White blood cells/leucocytes</li>
        <li>Platelets/thrombocytes</li>
        <li>Plasma</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>General Importance of Blood in the Bodies of Animals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It transports oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body.</li>
        <li>It transports digested food from the ileum to other parts of the body for use.</li>
        <li>It transports Carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs.</li>
        <li>It transports nitrogenous wastes from the liver to the kidney where they are excreted.</li>
        <li>It transports hormones from their site of production to where they perform their functions.</li>
        <li>It distributes heat and aids in temperature control.</li>
        <li>It prevents infection by transportation of white blood cells.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes)</h2>
    <p>These are very tiny cells. They are disc-shaped and biconcave and appear as discs which are thinner in the center than around the edge.</p>

    <h3>Importance of Red Blood Cells</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They transport oxygen from gaseous exchange surfaces to the tissues.</li>
        <li>They transport carbon dioxide from tissues to the gaseous exchange surfaces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Adaptation of Red Blood Cells to Carry Out Their Function</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They are biconcave in shape so as to avail a large surface area to volume ratio for absorption of oxygen.</li>
        <li>They have hemoglobin molecules that bind to oxygen and transport it from the lungs to the tissues.</li>
        <li>They have a thin membrane which reduces the diffusion distance for the respiratory gases in and out of the cells.</li>
        <li>They lack nuclei which provides enough space for packaging of hemoglobin.</li>
        <li>They lack mitochondria and generate their ATP exclusively by anaerobic respiration to prevent them from using the oxygen they are carrying.</li>
        <li>They are numerous per mm³ to increase surface area for transportation of oxygen.</li>
        <li>They have flexible membranes which make them able to squeeze through capillary networks as they exchange materials they transport with the surrounding tissues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The White Blood Cells (Leucocytes)</h2>
    <p>These are blood cells made from the white bone marrow of long bones. They are also made in the spleen and lymphatic system. They are responsible for defense of the body against infection. They are fewer in blood than the red blood cells.</p>

    <h3>Characteristics of White Blood Cells</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They have no definite shape (they are amoeboid).</li>
        <li>They have a nucleus even at maturity.</li>
        <li>They are relatively few in blood but their number increases when the body is attacked by an infection.</li>
        <li>They lack hemoglobin.</li>
        <li>They feed on foreign particles by phagocytosis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>White Blood Cells Categories</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phagocytes:</strong> These are white blood cells with a lobed nucleus. They ingest and destroy germs by phagocytosis.</li>
        <li><strong>Lymphocytes:</strong> These are white blood cells that defend the body by producing antibodies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Platelets (Thrombocytes)</h2>
    <p>These are blood cells formed as fragments in the bone marrows during the formation of red blood cells. They are responsible for blood clotting.</p>

    <h3>Characteristics of Platelets</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They are cell fragments.</li>
        <li>They are spherical in shape.</li>
        <li>They do not have a nucleus.</li>
        <li>They do not have hemoglobin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Functions of Platelets</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They play a role in blood clotting which protects the body against excessive loss of blood and entry of pathogens through the injured part.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Process of Blood Clotting</h2>
    <p>When blood is exposed to air as a result of a cut or wound, the platelets in the blood at the damaged tissue stimulate the release of a chemical called Thromboplastin (thrombokinase). In the presence of calcium ions and vitamin K, thromboplastin stimulates the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin enzyme...</p>

    <h2>Blood Plasma</h2>
    <p>This is the fluid part of blood. It is made up of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A soluble protein called fibrinogen that plays a role in blood clotting.</li>
        <li>Serum, a watery fluid containing a variety of substances transported from one part of the body to another.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples of Substances Dissolved in Plasma</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Hormones</li>
        <li>Lipids</li>
        <li>Enzymes</li>
        <li>Urea</li>
        <li>Carbon dioxide</li>
        <li>Plasma proteins</li>
        <li>Amino acids</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Functions of Blood Plasma</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To transport hormones from glands to the target sites.</li>
        <li>To transport food nutrients from the gut to other parts of the body.</li>
        <li>To transport antibodies to the infected parts of the body.</li>
        <li>To transport Urea from the liver to the kidneys for excretion.</li>
        <li>To transport carbon dioxide from the body muscles to the gaseous exchange system.</li>
        <li>To transport heat from the liver and body muscles to other body parts hence maintaining a constant body temperature range.</li>
        <li>To transport platelets to injured sites on the body so as to initiate blood clotting.</li>
        <li>To distribute salts around the body so as to maintain the body’s electrolytes balance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Capillary Exchange, Formation of Tissue Fluid, and Later Lymph</h2>
    <p>As blood flows from arterioles into blood capillaries, pressure builds up in the capillaries forcing small molecules like food materials and the fluid part of blood to leave the capillaries and enter the intercellular spaces, leaving behind large molecules like proteins in plasma and cells. Once the fluid is in the intercellular spaces of tissues, it is no longer called blood but tissue fluid. Once formed, the tissue fluid surrounds the cells...</p>

    <h2>Diseases Associated with the Heart</h2>
    <h3>Coronary Heart Diseases</h3>
    <p>These are diseases that arise when the blood supply of the heart is blocked or interrupted by a buildup of fats in the coronary artery...</p>
