    <h2>8.1 Surface Area to Volume Ratio</h2>
    <p>Surface area to volume ratio is an important aspect in gaseous exchange. It is obtained by calculating the total surface area and dividing it by the volume of the object in question. Consider two boxes A and B below:</p>

    <h3>Box A</h3>
    <p>Total surface area (A) = 2(2x1) + 2(1x2) + 2(2x2) = 16 cm²</p>
    <p>Volume of A (V) = 2x1x2 = 4 cm³</p>
    <p>Surface area to volume ratio of A = 16 / 4 = 4</p>

    <h3>Box B</h3>
    <p>Total surface area (A) = 2(3x2) + 2(3x4) + 2(2x4) = 52 cm²</p>
    <p>Volume of B (V) = 4x2x3 = 24 cm³</p>
    <p>Surface area to volume ratio of B = 52 / 24 ≈ 2.3</p>

    <p>The surface area to volume ratio of A is larger than that of B, which shows that smaller objects have a larger surface area to volume ratio than larger ones. This facilitates faster diffusion and ensures that all body tissues are supplied with respiratory gases.</p>

    <h2>8.2 Need for Transport Systems in Animals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Increases surface area of the organism for faster and bulkier exchange of substances.</li>
        <li>Large organisms have a small surface area to volume ratio, so diffusion alone can’t occur.</li>
        <li>Greater metabolic demands require faster delivery of substances to meet body demand.</li>
        <li>The large diffusion distance for transported substances between tissues and their sources necessitates a transport system.</li>
        <li>Organisms need to be supplied with materials for metabolism and excrete waste products.</li>
        <li>In large multicellular organisms, many cells are far from the surface, requiring a system to move materials to and from them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8.4 The Mammalian Heart</h2>
    <p>The heart functions to pump blood around the body and is surrounded by a pericardium. It consists of cardiac muscle tissue and is divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. Blood flow is maintained in one direction by valves.</p>

    <h2>Cardiac Cycle</h2>
    <p>The cardiac cycle involves two phases: refilling of the heart with blood and pumping of blood. During systole, the heart contracts to pump blood, and during diastole, it relaxes to refill with blood. These phases correspond to the sounds of 'lub' and 'dub' during a heartbeat.</p>

    <h2>8.5 Blood Vessels</h2>
    <h3>Arteries</h3>
    <p>Arteries carry blood away from the heart. They have thick, elastic walls to withstand high pressure.</p>
    <h3>Capillaries</h3>
    <p>Capillaries are small blood vessels with thin walls that allow diffusion of gases, nutrients, and waste products.</p>
    <h3>Veins</h3>
    <p>Veins carry blood back to the heart. They have thinner walls than arteries and contain valves to prevent backflow.</p>
