    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Bodies of all living organisms are made up of tiny microscopic units. These units collectively carry out processes that make the organism a living entity. These microscopic units are known as <strong>cells</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cells were first described in the year 1665 by a biologist, <strong>Robert Hooke</strong>, who used a microscope to observe them. His discoveries led to the development of the <strong>cell theory</strong>, which explains the properties of a cell.

    <h2>2.1 Meaning of the Cell</h2>
    <p>
      The cell is the basic unit of life. Some organisms are made up of only one cell and are referred to as <strong>unicellular</strong> organisms. Examples include <strong>amoeba</strong> and <strong>paramecium</strong>. Others, like humans, pine trees, and houseflies, are made up of many cells and are called <strong>multicellular</strong> organisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cell is both the structural and functional unit of life. It is the basic building block of all living organisms, much like how building blocks are used to form a house.
    </p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Cell+Structure" alt="Cell Structure">
    <p>
      Cells perform a variety of chemical processes that keep the organism alive. These processes are vital for maintaining the organism's functions and enabling reproduction and growth.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Characteristics of a Cell</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It is microscopic.</li>
      <li>It is membrane-bound.</li>
      <li>It contains organelles that serve as sites for chemical reactions.</li>
      <li>It has the ability to divide and replicate, as it contains genetic material.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2.2 Magnifying Instruments</h2>
    <p>
      To observe organisms and structures that are too small for the naked eye, magnifying instruments such as hand lenses and microscopes are used.
    </p>

    <h3>Hand Lens</h3>
    <p>
      A hand lens, or magnifying glass, is a simple optical tool used to magnify objects. It consists of a convex lens mounted on a frame made of wood, metal, or plastic.
    </p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Hand+Lens" alt="Hand Lens">
    <p>
      The image appears larger when observed through the hand lens, and magnification is calculated using the formula: 
      <strong>Magnification = (Image length) / (Object length)</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Using a Hand Lens</h3>
    <p>Follow these steps to use a hand lens correctly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hold the hand lens with one hand and place the specimen on a flat surface.</li>
      <li>Bring the lens over the specimen and look through it.</li>
      <li>Move the lens up and down to focus and magnify the image.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Light Microscope</h3>
    <p>
      A light microscope uses light to magnify small objects, including cells. It is the most commonly used type of microscope.
    </p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Light+Microscope" alt="Light Microscope">
    <p>
      The microscope consists of several parts that work together to magnify and focus the specimen for observation. These parts include the eyepiece, objective lenses, coarse and fine adjustment knobs, and the stage.
    </p>

        <td>Rotating part attached to the body tube.</td>
        <td>Holds the objective lenses and rotates to change magnification.</td>

    <h3>Steps to Use a Light Microscope</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Place the microscope on a bench with the arm facing you.</li>
      <li>Adjust the light using the iris diaphragm for clarity.</li>
      <li>Carefully mount the specimen on the slide and secure it with a cover slip.</li>
      <li>Use the coarse adjustment knob to bring the specimen into view.</li>
      <li>Switch to a higher magnification and use the fine adjustment knob for clearer focus.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Care and Maintenance of the Microscope</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep the lenses clean by using lens tissue and avoid touching them with fingers.</li>
      <li>Always focus upwards when looking through the eyepiece to avoid damaging the slide.</li>
      <li>Store the microscope in a dust-free place and cover it when not in use.</li>
    </ul>
