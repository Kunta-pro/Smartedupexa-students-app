    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Bodies of all living organisms are made up of tiny microscopic units. These units collectively carry out processes that make the organism a living entity. These microscopic units are known as <strong>cells</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cells were first described in the year 1665 by a biologist, <strong>Robert Hooke</strong>, who used a microscope to observe them. His discoveries led to the development of the <strong>cell theory</strong>, which explains the properties of a cell.
    </p>

    <h2>2.1 Meaning of the Cell</h2>
    <p>
      The cell is the basic unit of life. Some organisms are made up of only one cell and are referred to as <strong>unicellular</strong> organisms. Examples include <strong>amoeba</strong> and <strong>paramecium</strong>. Others, like humans, pine trees, and houseflies, are made up of many cells and are called <strong>multicellular</strong> organisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cell is both the structural and functional unit of life. It is the basic building block of all living organisms, much like how building blocks are used to form a house.
    </p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Cell+Structure" alt="Cell Structure">
    <p>
      Cells perform a variety of chemical processes that keep the organism alive. These processes are vital for maintaining the organism's functions and enabling reproduction and growth.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Characteristics of a Cell</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It is microscopic.</li>
      <li>It is membrane-bound.</li>
      <li>It contains organelles that serve as sites for chemical reactions.</li>
      <li>It has the ability to divide and replicate, as it contains genetic material.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2.2 Magnifying Instruments</h2>
    <p>
      To observe organisms and structures that are too small for the naked eye, magnifying instruments such as hand lenses and microscopes are used.
    </p>

    <h3>Hand Lens</h3>
    <p>
      A hand lens, or magnifying glass, is a simple optical tool used to magnify objects. It consists of a convex lens mounted on a frame made of wood, metal, or plastic.
    </p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Hand+Lens" alt="Hand Lens">
    <p>
      The image appears larger when observed through the hand lens, and magnification is calculated using the formula: 
      <strong>Magnification = (Image length) / (Object length)</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Using a Hand Lens</h3>
    <p>Follow these steps to use a hand lens correctly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hold the hand lens with one hand and place the specimen on a flat surface.</li>
      <li>Bring the lens over the specimen and look through it.</li>
      <li>Move the lens up and down to focus and magnify the image.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Light Microscope</h3>
    <p>
      A light microscope uses light to magnify small objects, including cells. It is the most commonly used type of microscope.
    </p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Light+Microscope" alt="Light Microscope">
    <p>
      The microscope consists of several parts that work together to magnify and focus the specimen for observation. These parts include the eyepiece, objective lenses, coarse and fine adjustment knobs, and the stage.
    </p>

    <h3>Parts of a Compound Light Microscope</h3>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Part</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Function</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Eyepiece</td>
        <td>Uppermost part of the microscope with lenses.</td>
        <td>Magnifies the object under study.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Coarse Adjustment Knob</td>
        <td>Big rotating knob on the side.</td>
        <td>Used for rough focusing.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Revolving Nosepiece</td>
        <td>Rotating part attached to the body tube.</td>
        <td>Holds the objective lenses and rotates to change magnification.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Steps to Use a Light Microscope</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Place the microscope on a bench with the arm facing you.</li>
      <li>Adjust the light using the iris diaphragm for clarity.</li>
      <li>Carefully mount the specimen on the slide and secure it with a cover slip.</li>
      <li>Use the coarse adjustment knob to bring the specimen into view.</li>
      <li>Switch to a higher magnification and use the fine adjustment knob for clearer focus.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Care and Maintenance of the Microscope</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep the lenses clean by using lens tissue and avoid touching them with fingers.</li>
      <li>Always focus upwards when looking through the eyepiece to avoid damaging the slide.</li>
      <li>Store the microscope in a dust-free place and cover it when not in use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Biological Drawings and Cell Structure</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2.3 Biological Drawings</h2>
        <p>You will be required to look at a large number of specimens during this course. You are much more likely to remember them if you draw them. Drawing a specimen requires you to pay attention to detail so that you can re-create it on the sheet. While doing this, your brain is recording these same features in such a way that you can recall them if necessary.</p>
        <h3>Guidelines for Drawing Biological Diagrams</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Look at the specimen carefully. Examine the significant features that can be included in the drawing.</li>
            <li>Draw only what you see. Do not include what you think you should see.</li>
            <li>All drawings must be done in pencil only and should be done on plain papers.</li>
            <li>Drawings must be large and clear so that features can be easily distinguished. They should be large enough to show all parts without crowding.</li>
            <li>Keep your drawings to the left of the page. Save the right-hand side of the page for labels.</li>
            <li>Never use arrows to label diagrams. Lines should be drawn with a ruler and parallel to each other. The lettering of the words should be horizontal and in pencil.</li>
            <li>Always use distinct, single lines when drawing. Avoid broken lines.</li>
            <li>Do not shade your drawings. Dark areas in a drawing to be indicated using dots.</li>
            <li>All drawings must have the following indicated:
                <ul>
                    <li>Title – give a full, clear and concise title that explains what is being illustrated.</li>
                    <li>Magnification – indicate the magnification at which the specimen was observed.</li>
                    <li>Labels – always include labels of the important features of the specimen. Each label line must be straight and should not overlap with other label lines; all labels must be to one side left or right.</li>
                    <li>Scale – always include a scale bar indicating the length or width of the specimen drawn.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Underline scientific names separately if hand written or italicized when you type.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Calculation of Magnification</h2>
        <p>Magnification is the process of enlarging something only in appearance but not in physical size. To find out the magnification of an image under a light microscope, you must consider the magnification of both the eyepiece lens and the objective lens.</p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> (Eyepiece lens magnification) × (Objective lens magnification) = Total magnification</p>
        <p>For example, if the microscope has an eyepiece lens of magnification ×10, and an objective lens magnification of ×10, then total magnification is:</p>
        <p>Total magnification = 10 × 10 = ×100</p>
        <table class="table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Eyepiece Magnification</th>
                    <th>Objective Lens Magnification</th>
                    <th>Total Magnification</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>×10</td>
                    <td>×8</td>
                    <td>×80</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>×15</td>
                    <td>×10</td>
                    <td>×150</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>×25</td>
                    <td>×40</td>
                    <td>×1000</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Note: Magnification is the number of times the size of the drawing multiplies the size of the specimen from where it has been drawn.</p>

        <h2>2.4 Structure of Plant & Animal Cells</h2>
        <p>The cell is the basic unit from which plants and animals are made. The cell itself is made up of smaller structures called organelles. Each organelle carries out a specific function just as it is in the family where the father, mother, and children have specific roles to play.</p>
        <h3>Cell Structure as Seen Under Light Microscope</h3>
        <p>Most cell organelles are transparent and may be difficult to see and draw. When such structures are dyed or stained with substances such as iodine, they become visible under the light microscope.</p>
        <h4>Animal Cell</h4>
        <p>Observed in an animal cell: cell membrane, nucleus, and cytoplasm.</p>
        <h4>Plant Cell</h4>
        <p>Observed in a plant cell: cell wall, nucleus, cytoplasm, chloroplasts, sap vacuole, and cell membrane.</p>
        <h3>Cell Structure as Seen Under an Electron Microscope</h3>
        <p>Some organelles that cannot be seen under the light microscope can be observed with higher magnification using an electron microscope.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Functions of Parts of Plant and Animal Cells</h2>
        <p><strong>Cell Wall:</strong> Provides mechanical support and gives the plant cells a definite shape. It allows gases, water, and other substances to move in and out of the cell.</p>
        <p><strong>Cell Membrane:</strong> Forms a barrier that separates the cell from its surroundings and regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell.</p>
        <p><strong>Cytoplasm:</strong> Fluid-filled medium in which chemical reactions take place and where organelles are suspended.</p>
        <p><strong>Nucleus:</strong> Controls all activities in the cell and carries genetic information in the DNA. It also controls cell division and growth.</p>
        <p><strong>Vacuoles:</strong> Fluid-filled sacs that store food or waste products, especially in unicellular organisms.</p>
        <p><strong>Chloroplasts:</strong> Contain chlorophyll and are responsible for photosynthesis in plant cells.</p>
        <p><strong>Mitochondria:</strong> The powerhouse of the cell where energy production takes place.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2.5 Specialized Cells and Their Functions</h2>

        <h3>Specialized Plant Cells</h3>

        <p>Some plant cells are structurally modified to perform specific functions. These specialized cells include root hair cells, mesophyll cells, xylem, and phloem vessels.</p>

        <h4>(a) Root Hair Cells</h4>
        <p>These are microscopic outgrowths located on the epidermal tissue of the roots. They are adapted for the absorption of water and mineral salts from the soil. Root hair cells are numerous and thin-walled to increase efficiency in absorption.</p>

        <h4>(b) Mesophyll Cells</h4>
        <p>Mesophyll cells are specialized for the process of photosynthesis. They contain chloroplasts. There are two types of mesophyll cells:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Palisade Cells:</strong> These are located in the palisade mesophyll layer. They are closely packed and near the epidermis to trap more sunlight and access more carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Palisade cells contain dense chloroplasts which are vital for maximum photosynthesis.</li>
            <li><strong>Spongy Mesophyll Cells:</strong> These are irregularly shaped and form the spongy mesophyll layer. They possess chloroplasts for photosynthesis and have intercellular spaces for the free movement of gases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Palisade cells are more suited for photosynthesis compared to spongy mesophyll cells.</p>

        <h4>(c) Xylem Vessels</h4>
        <p>Xylem vessels transport water and inorganic ions (mineral salts) from the roots to other parts of the plant. The living part of the cells degenerate during the formation of xylem, leaving hollow tubes for efficient conduction.</p>
        <h5>Adaptations of Xylem Vessels:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The walls are thickened with lignin to prevent collapse, providing mechanical support.</li>
            <li>The lumen is narrow to enhance capillarity, improving water transport.</li>
            <li>Lack of cross and end walls allows continuous flow of water.</li>
            <li>Bordered pits in the xylem allow lateral movement of water to other tissues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>(d) Phloem Tissue</h4>
        <p>Phloem tissues transport food substances in the plant. The cells are linked, with sieve pores allowing the passage of dissolved food substances between cells.</p>
        <h5>Adaptations of Phloem Tissue:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Sieve pores allow food substances to pass between cells.</li>
            <li>Companion cells contain organelles to provide energy for food transportation.</li>
            <li>Cytoplasmic filaments stream substances between sieve tubes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Phloem and xylem vessels are closely associated, forming vascular bundles.</p>

        <h4>(e) Guard Cells</h4>
        <p>Guard cells are located in the epidermal layer of the leaf and control the opening and closing of the stomata.</p>
        <h5>Adaptations of Guard Cells:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Guard cells contain chloroplasts, enabling photosynthesis which helps regulate osmotic pressure and control stomatal opening and closing.</li>
            <li>The bean-shaped structure of guard cells creates space for the stoma to open, allowing gas exchange.</li>
            <li>The outer walls are thinner than the inner walls, enabling the guard cells to stretch outwards, opening the stoma.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Specialized Animal Cells</h3>

        <p>Some animal cells are structurally modified to perform specific functions. These specialized cells include red blood cells, ciliated cells, nerve cells, sperm cells, and egg cells.</p>

        <h4>(a) Red Blood Cells</h4>
        <p>Red blood cells transport oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body.</p>
        <h5>Adaptations of Red Blood Cells:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>They have a biconcave shape, increasing surface area for oxygen absorption.</li>
            <li>Lack of a nucleus allows more space for hemoglobin.</li>
            <li>Thin walls reduce the distance for diffusion, facilitating faster gas exchange.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, which binds with oxygen to form oxyhemoglobin.</p>

        <h4>(b) Nerve Cells</h4>
        <p>Nerve cells (neurons) conduct electrical impulses throughout the body.</p>
        <h5>Adaptations of Nerve Cells:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Nerve cells have an axon to transmit impulses.</li>
            <li>Some have a myelin sheath that insulates electrical impulses.</li>
            <li>They have dendrites for receiving impulses and transmitting them to adjacent neurons.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>(c) Sperm Cells</h4>
        <p>Sperm cells are male gametes that fertilize the female gamete (egg cell) to form a zygote.</p>
        <h5>Adaptations of Sperm Cells:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Sperm cells have a tail to swim toward the egg for fertilization.</li>
            <li>They contain many mitochondria for energy to swim.</li>
            <li>The acrosome contains enzymes to break down the egg's membrane for fertilization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>(d) Egg Cell</h4>
        <p>The egg cell (ovum) is the female gamete that fuses with the sperm to form a zygote.</p>
        <h5>Adaptations of Egg Cells:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The egg cell has dense cytoplasm and yolk that nourish the zygote before implantation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>(e) Ciliated Cells</h4>
        <p>Ciliated cells are found in the nose and windpipe. They have cilia, tiny hair-like structures, which help move mucus and trap dust and germs.</p>
